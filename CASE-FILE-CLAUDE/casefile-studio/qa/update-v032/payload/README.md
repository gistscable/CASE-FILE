# Casefile Studio v0.3.2
## A source-led documentary production workspace

A working **single-workspace prototype** for a browser-based, AI-assisted true-crime YouTube workflow, with **20–40 minute episode targets**. This is not yet a fully autonomous professional production service.

The app now has a dedicated **Episode setup** path for a finished voice + narration script + footage guide + music + actual source files. The original **Research → Script → Edit → Review & export** workspace remains available for the other starting modes.

## New in v0.3.2 — easy-to-find timestamp input

- A dedicated **Narration timestamps (SRT / JSON)** panel is directly below the four audio/document cards, with a persistent **Upload SRT / JSON** button. It is no longer buried in Finished narration.
- A **SRT / JSON timestamps** shortcut at the top scrolls straight to it. Attached filenames explicitly say **Attached to this project**; imports are per episode.
- The Source files section explicitly states that guide links are references, **not automatically downloaded media**. Upload actual authorized footage/photos; full originals and original filenames can be used.
- The interface displays **v0.3.2**, and CSS/script URLs are versioned to make stale-browser-cache issues easier to spot.
- This is a code/UI update. No existing project, audio, guide, source binding, or export is automatically replaced. See **[TIMESTAMP-INPUTS.md](TIMESTAMP-INPUTS.md)**. The optional code-only updater preserves `data/` rather than replacing it with example data.

## New in v0.3.1 — CapCut timing + optional exact-caption track

- Import a full CapCut `draft_info.json` (up to 32 million characters), then its matching SRT, in either order. `.srt.md` uploads are accepted when their content is SRT. Only sanitized caption/timing data and an audio **basename** are retained; device IDs and local paths are not copied into the project.
- Relative word-unit milliseconds are placed on the segment's microsecond timeline. A date/phrase may be one timed unit: no interior start is labeled exact. Single-word substitutions are explicit **review candidates**, not approved matches or acoustic alignment.
- SRT blocks, including continuous-caption holds, are preserved in the sidecar. Burn-in caption fragments follow the same clock across visual cuts. Empty imported intervals never regenerate estimated captions. **Captions OFF changes visibility only**, not guide cuts or the narration clock.
- Transcript differences have a visible review panel and separate producer sign-off. Files with mismatched starts are rejected instead of globally shifted; mismatched recording duration is flagged instead of stretched.
- **The Last Timeline now has the two supplied timing exports loaded:** 390 caption blocks, 2,353 timed units, 43 proposed cue starts (35 normalized matches + 8 text-substitution candidates), a 15:03.533 exported clock, and a **56-scene all-gap timed plan**. Actual narration, music, and footage are still missing. Its original script/guide are unchanged; it is not a finished video.

See **[CAPCUT-TIMING.md](CAPCUT-TIMING.md)** for this input audit, limits, and the next required file.

## New in v0.3 — the supplied episode-pack workflow

Open **The Last Timeline → Episode setup** in the included workspace. Its user-supplied script and real-footage guide are already loaded in separate cards; **no narration, music, or source media has been supplied**. The two original uploads remain unchanged. See **[EPISODE-WORKFLOW.md](EPISODE-WORKFLOW.md)** for the practical, nontechnical walkthrough.

- Separate inputs for **finished narration, background music, narration script, editing guide, optional SRT/word timings, and actual source files**. A guide cannot silently overwrite the script.
- Local **At / Show / Preview / Label / Care** parsing in the supplied guide's format. The supplied pack has **2,366 spoken words, a hook + 12 chapters, 43/43 matching phrases, 24 references, and 15 sources used by placements**.
- Explicit source-ID bindings (including **S01**, not S1), filename suggestions, per-file reuse notes/attestations, and per-placement exact local in/out and Care/context reviews. No imported source or permission is automatically approved.
- Guide-aware planning: source/date labels, muted source audio, explicit stop requirements for context switches, residential-source restrictions in chapter 3, no unrelated substitutions, and **marked gaps rather than silently looped short clips**.
- The uploaded voice is the continuous master. Guided renders require that real recording, preserve its full order/runtime, and reject stale plans, altered guide timing, unapproved sources, or out-of-range footage. Source files cannot masquerade as the voice/music role. There are no silent guide-documentary exports.
- Music loops and ducks under the voice. Local commands include **“set music to 8%”**, look changes, captions, and titles. Destructive guide timing/story commands are rejected; revise guide cues in Setup and rebuild instead.
- Plans without audio are allowed, but rendering stays disabled. The included **56-scene timed plan has no media**, uses the supplied CapCut clock rather than the historical 145-wpm estimate, and is not a documentary. The exact recording must still be uploaded and checked.
- The exported **frozen episode plan** records cue phrases, exact file windows, labels, Care rules, linked files, recorded reuse notes, and visual gaps alongside the existing handoff files.

**No AI key is needed for this path.** This version does not download YouTube/news footage, request licenses, semantically identify people/places, automatically crop/blur privacy details, or implement cleared broadcast inserts between narration paragraphs. Supply safe authorized files and review context yourself. Free-text editing-brief notes are recorded, not arbitrarily executed.

### Start with your supplied inputs

1. Open the live app, switch to **The Last Timeline**, and click **Episode setup**. A fresh browser normally opens this project by default.
2. Add your **finished narration** in card 1 and optional **background music** in card 2. The script and editing guide in cards 3 and 4 are already present.
3. Import the actual authorized source clips/photos. Match names such as `S03.mp4` or link each source manually. Record reuse notes and review each cue's exact local window, label, and Care instructions.
4. Check the proposed cue positions and transcript differences against the voice; optionally import the matching CapCut JSON + SRT, then **Preview / Rebuild episode plan**.
5. **View timeline** or **Create review video**. If coverage is incomplete, explicitly allow visibly marked gap cards for an internal review-only MP4. The app never invents the missing real footage.
6. Watch the whole MP4 and resolve factual, source, privacy/context, timing, rights, and picture/sound checks before considering a final export. Structural preflight and producer attestations are not independent verification or legal clearance.

For the next episode, use **New project → Narration + media** and supply the same separate inputs. Other guide formats need adaptation; the parser is not a general semantic understanding engine.

### Retained from v0.2

- **Produce draft:** a guided, resumable run from the material you have. It assembles scenes, fills missing visual assignments from your imports, reuses or explicitly generates narration, and queues a real review render.
- **Human review stops:** topic research stops for source review; AI-written scripts stop for producer approval before narration. No source is marked reviewed automatically.
- **Per-run paid consent:** paid work is off by default, needs a connected key and explicit approval for that run, and has a configurable narration-character ceiling. This is not a currency budget or a cap on other provider charges. Saved stages are reused on the next run; consent resets when reopening the production dialog.
- **Stronger preflight:** unresolved factual markers, missing source IDs, missing files or rights notes, narration bounds, script approval, and editorial sign-offs. Final rendering stays locked when blocking checks fail.
- **A portable claim trail:** `[S1]`, `[S1, S2]`, and related source references survive assembly and scene edits. Edit a scene's source IDs and chapter label in its inspector.
- **Publication handoff:** every new export includes its frozen preflight report, chapter draft, and publication checklist alongside the MP4, SRT, source notes, and project snapshot. These are aids for a producer—not a publishing or legal-clearance service.

### Explore the unchanged fictional sample

1. Open the **Casefile Studio** live preview.
2. Switch projects and explore **The Blackwater tapes**, the clearly labeled fictional sample. It contains AI-created illustrative scenery, no real case facts, and no spoken narration.
3. In **Edit**, select a scene, change its duration, drag a trim handle, or split it at the playhead.
4. Type **“use the archive look”** or **“set scene 2 to 12 seconds”** into the direction box. These commands work without an AI key. Undo restores the previous saved edit.
5. Open **Review & export**. A real, approximately 88-second **720p silent sample MP4** has already been rendered in this workspace and can be downloaded from the export history.
6. Open **Produce draft** to inspect the production path and deliberate review stops. Use **Preflight checks** in Review to see what still prevents a final export.
7. Create a **New project** for your actual material. Do not repurpose the fictional demo for real case research; its fictional disclosure is deliberately retained in rendered files.

## What works now

| Feature | Status / requirements |
|---|---|
| Project creation, autosave, and reload persistence | Local JSON files on the server |
| Four project entry points | Topic, finished script, narration + media, raw footage |
| Source library and producer review | Manual source links, offline records, producer-verified notes, scene-level source IDs |
| Guided production | Available-stage runner; pauses/resumes at source, script, media, consent, and connection gates |
| AI-script approval | Text + cited-source fingerprint; substantive text/source edits require fresh producer approval |
| Script-to-scene assembly | Local paragraph/sentence splitting, estimated timing at 145 wpm |
| Media import | Images, video, audio, TXT, and Markdown |
| Visual assignment | Episode Setup: exact guide source bindings + reviewed ranges; nonguide legacy assembly: filename matching/rotation |
| Scene editing | Reorder, duration, source in-point, split, left/right trim, titles, motion, transitions |
| Editable look | Noir, archive, natural |
| Captions | Guided imported SRT/CapCut blocks preserved; visibility optional. No-import fallback remains estimated. |
| Audio | Uploaded narration/music; actual waveform extraction; approximate browser playback |
| Render engine | Real FFmpeg H.264 MP4, 24 fps, 480p / 720p / 1080p, AAC when audio is present |
| Export audio processing | Guide: unchanged continuous voice with music ducking/looping/fades and mix limiting; legacy: also narration leveling |
| Scene/audio linkage | Guide projects: continuous preserved master; legacy nonguide projects: source slices follow scene reordering/trimming |
| Export artifacts | MP4, SRT, source/rights notes, project snapshot, preflight Markdown/JSON, chapters, and publication checklist |
| Draft/final gate | Watermarked drafts; editorial preflight required for final export; missing media blocks all renders |
| Local text commands | Captions, titles, look, music level; scene duration/move are restricted to nonguide projects |
| AI research, writing, narration, transcription, creative direction | Optional provider adapters; requires a separately billed API key |

**What is not automatic:** the app does not find and license a complete set of true-crime visuals or music. You must provide/clear the assets. It also does not independently verify case facts, do legal clearance, or reliably make every creative decision a professional editor would make.

## Optional AI connection

Open **Settings / Connect AI** and enter an **OpenAI API key in the app's private connection field**, not in the conversation.

- The API key is held in server memory for that browser session. It is never written to project JSON, media, export manifests, or browser storage.
- An opaque session token is stored in `sessionStorage`; this is not the API key. The same-origin session header supports embedded live previews where third-party cookies are blocked.
- Restarting the server disconnects the key. Disconnecting does not cancel an AI request already in progress.
- Account/model access and API billing are separate from any chat subscription.
- Research sends the topic to the provider's web-search tool. Writing/direction send the relevant text and asset metadata. Narration sends script text. Transcription sends the selected audio in compressed chunks.
- No paid AI calls were made while building the sample. Live paid-provider operations are **wired but not credential-tested**; adapter behavior is covered by mocked-response tests.

Defaults: Responses API with `gpt-4.1` for writing/editing and web research; `whisper-1` for segment-timed transcription; Speech API with `gpt-4o-mini-tts` / `onyx` for narration. Model fields are editable in Settings.

**Provider lifecycle warning:** the provider documentation retrieved on 23 October 2026 says the current Speech API model defaults are scheduled to shut down on **6 January 2027**. The narration adapter will need migration to the provider's replacement workflow before then; changing the model name alone may not be enough. The adapter lives in `ai.py`.

### Use legacy Produce draft (projects without an editing guide)

Open **Produce draft**, choose any source recording, and review the stage plan. **Fill missing visual assignments** preserves curated choices. Paid work and voice generation require separate explicit choices; the app never silently chooses paid narration. With no voice or visuals it stops, unless you explicitly allow a **silent picture draft** or **placeholder visuals** for review.

Click **Run available stages**. When the workflow pauses, use its **Open Research / Script / Edit / Settings** action to resolve the issue. Reopen Produce draft and approve any paid work needed for the next run. A finished run creates a watermarked MP4; it does not publish or clear the final review checks. Exports are snapshots, so rerun after making edits.

The following manual stage controls also remain available. Clicking a manual AI research/write/transcribe/narrate button directly requests provider work with the connected key; the guided run's paid-consent checkbox does not govern those separate manual actions.

### Workflow by starting material

**Topic only**
1. Enter a specific case name, location, and identifying context in Research.
2. Research the case with a connected API key.
3. Open original sources, record checked facts/context in the notes, and mark sources reviewed.
4. Draft from reviewed sources, then read and approve the AI script in Script before generating narration. The requested length is a target, not permission to pad with invented material.
5. Import licensed visuals and music. Review the scene assignments and source IDs.
6. Generate or upload narration; review the edit, run Preflight checks, and render.

**Finished script**
1. Paste the script or import a TXT/Markdown file.
2. Use blank lines between scene-sized paragraphs, usually 35–65 words.
3. Import your media, then Build timeline.
4. Add a voice track or generate narration. Generated voice lengths align the scene durations.

**Recorded narration + script / editing guide**
1. Use **Episode setup**, not Transcribe & assemble. See [EPISODE-WORKFLOW.md](EPISODE-WORKFLOW.md). No AI key is needed; import the script and guide separately and upload the finished voice/music.

**Recorded narration without an editing guide (legacy path)**
1. Use the existing media library to import files and select the voice track in the Audio panel or media details.
2. With an AI connection, use Transcribe & assemble for source-segment timing.
3. Alternatively, paste the matching script and build locally; timing is estimated and needs review.

**Raw footage / interview**
1. Import the recording.
2. Use Transcribe & assemble. This assembles a source-aligned timeline for the selected recording and replaces the current timeline; Undo is available.
3. Refine the sequence, add B-roll, and review every cut. This is not yet a multicamera editor or an automatic multi-interview documentary assembler.

## Run the source locally

Tested with Python 3.13, Node 20, and FFmpeg 7 on Linux. Python 3.11+ is recommended.

### 1. Install system tools

Install `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, with H.264, AAC, and libass/subtitle support. Install DejaVu Sans fonts for titles and captions.

Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg fonts-dejavu-core
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
```bash
cd casefile-studio
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch

The bundle includes prebuilt browser assets; Node is only needed to change/rebuild the UI.

```bash
./run.sh
# or:
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. In a hosted preview, use its provided URL instead. The browser uses only relative API/media URLs—no browser-facing localhost backend calls.

### Rebuild the frontend
```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```
The frontend is React + Lucide icons, bundled by esbuild. Its font, CSS, scripts, and sample image are served locally; no CDN is needed at runtime.

### Docker (private local test)
```bash
docker build -t casefile-studio .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 -v casefile-data:/app/data casefile-studio
```

The Docker image excludes the workspace data. It creates the fictional demo on first run; render its sample export if you want one inside that installation.

## Tests and verification

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest -q tests
```

**92 passing regression tests** cover the original editor plus guided production, paid-consent/connection safeguards, character caps, review stops, cancellation/error preservation, stage reuse, recording selection and source alignment, AI approval/invalidation, source preservation, missing rights/files, voice bounds, export artifacts, and real FFmpeg renders. Provider responses are mocked. New Episode tests parse both supplied documents, exercise explicit roles, permission/context/range guards, word/SRT clocks, stale-plan/tamper rejection, full contiguous narration, and guide labels. A real short guide render verifies that source audio is muted and the narration tail survives; the legacy integration test still verifies reordered narration by output frequency.

Optional browser smoke test against a running server:
```bash
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
python tests/browser_smoke.py
python tests/browser_production.py
python tests/browser_episode.py
```

**29 passing browser checks** (10 original + 8 legacy guided-production + 11 Episode Setup checks) cover the editor, real queued MP4 export/download, producer approval/invalidation, paid-stage gating, preflight navigation to a rights repair, final-export locking, automatic visual fill, frozen handoff downloads, persistence, and mobile layouts. No browser runtime errors were observed. The AI-origin text used to test approval UI is an explicitly simulated temporary fixture, not a live provider response.

Historical v0.2 long-form technical check (not rerun as a complete v0.3 guide-driven documentary):
```bash
python tests/long_render_check.py
```
A real **20-minute synthetic render passed in v0.2**: 60 scenes, 28,800 frames at 24 fps, 854×480 H.264/AAC, 12 video scenes, 8 moving-still scenes, captions, test-tone narration, and a music bed. Output duration was **1200.0 seconds**; the caption end and non-silent audio at the tail were verified. It took **207.94 seconds** on this sandbox for this particular media mix. This is **not** a 1080p performance promise, speech-sync assessment, real case documentary, production load test, or paid-provider validation. The test deletes its large synthetic fixtures/output after success and keeps `qa/long-form-validation.json`.

Also verified: the approximately 88-second 720p silent fictional demo, short real picture/audio test renders, and a short 1080p render. A complete **real 20–40 minute episode with live paid AI** still has **not** been end-to-end validated.

## Limits and professional-production work still needed

- **Single shared workspace, no user authentication.** Do not expose this prototype publicly or upload confidential evidence. Production needs authentication, per-user authorization, private object storage, signed downloads, retention/deletion controls, and an audit trail.
- Jobs run in a thread pool; one CPU render runs at a time. Interrupted jobs are marked after restart, not automatically resumed. Guided production can reuse already-saved stages when you explicitly run it again; it cannot recover an in-flight provider request. Cancellation/errors can still incur provider charges. Projects are read-only during non-render production jobs. A production system needs a durable queue, managed workers, quotas, and observability.
- CPU rendering can take substantial time for a 20–40 minute episode. The synthetic 480p test is only one measured media mix; no production performance or load guarantee is made.
- Import limit: **512 MB per file, 30 files per batch**. Project limit: **400 scenes**, up to **90 minutes** exported. Large camera masters may need external proxy/transcode storage.
- Supported output is **16:9**, up to **1080p**, at **24 fps**. No 4K, HDR, broadcast color management, multicam, ripple-edit parity with a professional NLE, or NLE interchange export is implemented.
- Browser monitor/mix is an approximate editing preview; the downloaded MP4 is authoritative. Export applies the selected subtitles/titles and music processing. Guide narration stays a continuous master; the legacy nonguide renderer also levels narration.
- Script-derived captions are estimated. Generated narration is scene-aligned, not word-aligned. Transcription gives source-segment alignment but still requires recognition/timing review.
- Creative AI narration rewrites detach the old voice track to avoid silently mismatching speech. Re-record or regenerate it.
- Build timeline is required after script-only edits; final export rejects unapplied script changes.
- Legacy automatic visual assignment is basic filename matching/rotation. Episode Setup uses the supplied guide IDs and reviewed source windows, but still does not semantically verify images, context, identities, or rights.
- Final export checks combine structural checks with producer attestations, **not** independent fact checking or legal clearance. Source links and rights notes do not prove truth or permission. The chapter draft may need grouping to meet YouTube chapter requirements; publication notes flag short/fewer-than-three chapter drafts.
- Media removed from a project is retained on disk so undo/history and existing manifests can still reference it. Production needs a deliberate retention/garbage-collection policy. Back up and delete the entire workspace data deliberately when appropriate.
